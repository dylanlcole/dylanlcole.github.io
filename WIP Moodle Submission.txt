We decided to design a section-based app to control four different types of home products: Media, Atmosphere, Security and Appliances.

Media: TV and Sound System
Within TV, we have multiple buttons for selecting Netflix, Hulu, etc.

Atmosphere: Lights, Temperature
After reaching temperature, we have options for turning on/off AC and heating, with easily accessible buttons for increasing or decreasing temperature.

Security: Alarm On/Off, Lock Doors

Appliances: Washer/Dryer, Dishwasher, Garage Door


On the main page, each section will have four buttons in the four main directions (Up: Appliances, Right: Atmosphere, Left: Media, Down: Security.
